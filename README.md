# NewsBlendApplication
The News Blend App is a web application built using Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to deliver an engaging and responsive user experience for viewing the latest news. The application features user authentication and profile management, leveraging Spring Security to secure endpoints. The frontend, styled with CSS and enriched with JavaScript for interactivity, displays dynamic news content fetched from an external API. Thymeleaf is used for server-side rendering of HTML templates, enabling seamless integration between the backend and frontend. The backend, powered by Spring Boot, handles business logic, data persistence with a MySQL database, and RESTful APIs for efficient data handling. This project demonstrates the integration of modern web development practices to create a full-stack application with clean design and robust functionality.
